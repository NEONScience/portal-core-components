    "productAbstract": "NEON AOP Field Spectral Data are collected using a field-spectrometer and leaf clip to observe leaf-level reflectance spectra within two-weeks of AOP overpass. Some field spectral observations will be collected from samples that are also used to develop the foliar chemistry data product. The Field Spectral Data are collected and distributed as an opportunistic activity and as such are not collected for every flight or site. Typical collection rates will be one or two sites annually.\n \n\nLatency:\n\nField spectral data will be available 90 days after the final collection day at a site. Field spectra legacy data (those collected in 2013 through 2016) currently has no availability, and will be completely available by April of 2020.",
