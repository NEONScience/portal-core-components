    "productAbstract": "This data product describes the volume of water flowing through a stream or river cross-section during a given period of time. For each NEON stream or river site, site-specific stage-discharge rating curve equations are derived from point observations of gauge height and discharge. Continuous sensor measurements of surface water pressure are used to derive water column height. The rating curve equations are applied to water column height to derive continuous stream discharge.\n\nLatency:\nData collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.",
    "productDesignDescription": "NEON calculates continuous stream discharge in all rivers and wadeable stream sites within the Observatory. Stream discharge data are calculated using pressure of surface water L0 data (DP0.20016; the raw, level 0 inputs used to calculate Elevation of surface water, DP1.20016), stream discharge rating curve data (DP4.00133), gauge height data (DP1.20267.001) and geolocation information. Continuous discharge data are reported once per minute.",
    "productStudyDescription": "This data product is measured at NEON aquatic wadeable stream and river sites.",
    "productBasicDescription": "The basic package contains the primary measurements and quality flags.",
    "productExpandedDescription": "The expanded package includes additional details about quality flagging and information related to the relationship between pressure measurements and periodic staff gauge readings.",
    "productSensor": "Level TROLL 500",
    "productRemarks": "Queries for this product will return data for all dates within the specified date range. Continuous stream discharge data are provided at one-minute intervals. Preliminary data for continuous discharge are calculated using the rating curve from the preceding water year (October 1 - September 31), while the annual versions are re-calculated following the end of the water year in which the pressure data was recorded, using the most recent rating curve. The data package includes unique identifiers for the curve fit to stage-discharge rating curves, uncertainty values at the 95% confidence intervals, and data quality flags associated with individual discharge values.",
